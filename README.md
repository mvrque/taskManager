How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
This project was built on object-oriented programming using Javascript Classes. I also tested using a bootstrap theme with this project.


Optimizations:
This project needs some bug fixes - needs to show today's date when opening the page or adding a task; need to make local storage also work.


Lessons Learned:
I learned how more on Javascript classes and using a bootstrap theme. Also practiced Javascript in general.
